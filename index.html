                    <h3>Problem</h3>
                    <p>
                        The adoption of online learning by academic
                        institutions has become common.
                        
                        However, this brings along issues such as
                        the disconnect between the students and
                        the instructor, and high drop out rates,
                        among others.
                        
                        Our research looks at the Critical Success
                        Factors (CSFs), which help alleviate these
                        issues.

                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                    <p>
                        The research is broken into two separate
                        sub-projects, each aimed at addressing a
                        specific CSF. 

                        One sub-project will focus on Student-Instructor
                        Interactions (SIIs), and the ways in which they
                        can be improved in an asynchronous learning
                        environment.

                        The other will focus on the Gamification CSF 
                        which when implemented, could help improve
                        first year Computer Science Courses (CS1).

            <h1>Student-Instructor Interactions</h1>
            <div class="content-outer">

                    <p>
                        It is difficult to foster student-instructor interactions in
                        large online classes, and students generally perform
                        poorly in the absence of interactions with the
                        instructor. Online forums often suffer from
                        delayed responses, and sometimes no responses at all.
                        This impacts learning outcomes negatively. 
                        Asynchronous lecture videos, although central to
                        online learning, provide students with no efficient
                        ways of asking questions in the middle of a lecture
                        video, and questions verbally posed by instructors to
                        students, do not guarantee responses from the
                        students. With most academic institutions adopting an
                        online learning strategy, effective methods of
                        encouraging student-instructor interactions become
                        key.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>
                        We proposed to build a web application that would couple 
                        each lecture video with its own dedicated forum, in 
                        order to reduce the complexities associated with the 
                        current method of making forum posts on the Vula LMS.

                        The web system will also house a mandatory in-lecture 
                        quiz system, so that instructors can ask questions and 
                        get responses from all students, in an asynchronous 
                        environment. Our research questions were as follows:
                    </p>
                    <p>                       
                        1. What effect does the pairing of lecture videos with
                        distinct forums, have on Student-Instructor
                        Interactions? Does the close proximity and ease of
                        access compel students to make posts?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2. What is the effect of incorporating mandatory quizzes
                        on Student-Instructor Interactions? Would students like
                        it, and would they feel as if it improves their
                        interactions with the instructor?
